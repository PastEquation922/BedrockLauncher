# Disclaimers
- This tool will not let you pirate **Minecraft for Windows 10**, as this launcher requires you to own a copy of it from the Microsoft Store.
- This tool is still in *Early Public Beta*; hence there will be a lot of issues.
- This tool is open source, and contributing is appreciated; however, redistributing the build is not recommended.
- The screenshots shown may not represent the actual product due to early rapid prototyping.
